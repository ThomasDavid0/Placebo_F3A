# Placebo, 2m F3A Plane

This repo contains all the cutting files and information required to build the Placebo F3A plane. The Placebo is a development of my old design, 
the Cold Draft, which is pretty good. Changes from that are incremental. The first prototype has just been test flown and first impressions
are encouraging. There may be errors in the design, parts that dont fit and so on. If you find any mistakes please submit an issue and
I'll try to fix them. If you start to build one please consider contributing to this project by writing or making corrections to the instructions, 
adding your files for design changes and other helpful things. 

Build instructions will eventually be found [here](https://thomasdavid0.github.io/Placebo_F3A/).

The design was made in Fusion 360. To access the 3D models, open these links:
